### Hej ðŸ‘‹
#### Welcome to my GITHUB page

I am Sendy. 
I am a professional with extensive experience in procurement field specifically in mining business. I have been working in the international organization so I am very familiar with equal and open culture and I also enjoy working in a team. Right now I am attached to data analytics stuff and tried to learn and practice as much as possible outside of my study time at the University. Currently I am focusing in learning SQL and Power BI. Also added a little Python and Tableau. I aspired to be a business or data analyst, hoping to be able to combine my business acumen with strong analytics driven decision. 

My linkedin profile is [Sendy Setiawan'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sendy-setiawan-scm14/)
